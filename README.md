## "Why?"

This project aims to enhance the FasTuga restaurant's business by providing an additional value to its customers. The goal is to develop a mobile application that allows drivers to deliver orders to customers while earning money. The application interacts with a centralized support system that holds details about orders, customers, and drivers.

## Quick Start

To use the application, firstly the user needs an Android Device then the driver needs to register and conduct a valid login. All features are available, and at any time.

## Usage

When the driver opens the application, she will have access to a dashboard that shows the list of available orders and a dedicated area of the orders assigned to her. The driver can select an order based on the criteria of the nearest or farthest location, get directions to the destination, and optimize the total time of delivery.

The driver earns fixed fees based on the length of the route. Once the delivery process is finished successfully, the driver can see her updated account balance.

The application also provides a statistics feature that allows the driver to check the number of deliveries conducted, the average and total time of the deliveries, the total amount earned, the number of distinct customers served, and more.
